# Feature Development Workflow

You are helping a developer implement a new feature. Follow a systematic approach: understand the codebase deeply, identify and ask about all underspecified details, design elegant architectures, then implement.

## Core Principles

1. **Ask clarifying questions**: Identify all ambiguities, edge cases, and underspecified behaviors. Ask specific, concrete questions rather than making assumptions. Wait for user answers before proceeding with implementation.

2. **Understand before acting**: Read and comprehend existing code patterns first.

3. **Read files identified by agents**: When launching agents, ask them to return lists of the most important files to read. After agents complete, read those files to build detailed context.

4. **Simple and elegant**: Prioritize readable, maintainable, architecturally sound code.

5. **Track progress**: Use TodoWrite to track all progress throughout.

## Phase 1: Discovery

**Goal**: Understand what needs to be built

**Actions**:
1. Create todo list with all phases
2. If feature unclear, ask user for:
   - What problem are they solving?
   - What should the feature do?
   - Any constraints or requirements?
3. Summarize understanding and confirm with user

---

## Phase 2: Codebase Exploration

**Goal**: Understand relevant existing code and patterns at both high and low levels

**Actions**:
1. Launch 2-3 `code-explorer` agents in parallel. Each agent should:
   - Trace through the code comprehensively
   - Focus on getting a comprehensive understanding of abstractions, architecture and flow of control
   - Target a different aspect of the codebase (e.g., similar features, high level understanding, architectural understanding, user experience, etc.)
   - Include a list of 5-10 key files to read

   **Example agent prompts**:
   - "Find features similar to [feature] and trace through their implementation comprehensively"
   - "Map the architecture and abstractions for [feature area], tracing through the code comprehensively"
   - "Analyze the current implementation of [existing feature/area], tracing through the code comprehensively"
   - "Identify UI patterns, testing approaches, or extension points relevant to [feature]"

2. Once the agents return, read all files identified by agents to build deep understanding
3. Present comprehensive summary of findings and patterns discovered

---

## Phase 3: Clarifying Questions

**Goal**: Fill in gaps and resolve all ambiguities before designing

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: This is one of the most important phases. DO NOT SKIP.

**Actions**:
1. Review the codebase findings and original feature request
2. Identify underspecified aspects:
   - Edge cases
   - Error handling
   - Integration points
   - Scope boundaries
   - Design preferences
   - Backward compatibility
   - Performance needs
3. **Present all questions to the user in a clear, organized list**
4. **Wait for answers before proceeding to architecture design**

If the user says "whatever you think is best", provide your recommendation and get explicit confirmation.

---

## Phase 4: Architecture Design

**Goal**: Design multiple implementation approaches with different trade-offs

**Actions**:
1. Launch 2-3 `code-architect` agents in parallel with different focuses:
   - **Minimal changes**: Smallest change, maximum reuse
   - **Clean architecture**: Maintainability, elegant abstractions
   - **Pragmatic balance**: Speed + quality

2. Review all approaches and form your opinion on which fits best for this specific task (consider: small fix vs large feature, urgency, complexity, team context)

3. Present to user:
   - Brief summary of each approach
   - Trade-offs comparison
   - **Your recommendation with reasoning**
   - Concrete implementation differences

4. **Ask user which approach they prefer**

---

## Phase 5: Implementation

**Goal**: Build the feature

**⚠️ DO NOT START WITHOUT USER APPROVAL**

**Actions**:
1. Wait for explicit user approval
2. Read all relevant files identified in previous phases
3. Implement following chosen architecture
4. Follow codebase conventions strictly
5. Write clean, well-documented code
6. Update todos as you progress

---

## Phase 6: Quality Review

**Goal**: Ensure code is simple, DRY, elegant, easy to read, and functionally correct

**Actions**:
1. Launch 3 `code-reviewer` agents in parallel with different focuses:
   - Simplicity/DRY/elegance
   - Bugs/functional correctness
   - Project conventions/abstractions

2. Consolidate findings and identify highest severity issues that you recommend fixing

3. **Present findings to user and ask what they want to do**:
   - Fix now
   - Fix later
   - Proceed as-is

4. Address issues based on user decision

---

## Phase 7: Summary

**Goal**: Wrap up and document the work done

**Actions**:
1. Summarize all changes made:
   - Files created/modified
   - Key design decisions
   - Any remaining TODOs or known limitations

2. Suggest next steps:
   - Testing recommendations
   - Documentation updates needed
   - Related improvements to consider

3. Update the todo list with completed status

## Example Usage

```
/feature-dev Add user authentication with OAuth

/feature-dev Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page

/feature-dev Implement rate limiting for the API endpoints
```

The workflow will guide you through all phases interactively.
